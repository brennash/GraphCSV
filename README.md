# GraphCSV
Creates a NVD3.js graph in a HTML file for a given CSV. 

## Usage
To use the package, either import the class, or run the binary as follows,

```
python CreateGraph.py <csv-file>
```

The resulting HTML file cannot be served unless you have a web-server 
running on the localhost. For simplicity you can spin up a small 
web-server within the working directory by typing

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
